    "Which starting grid positions have the highest likelihood of winning a Formula 1 race on each circuit, considering track type (street versus permanent), circuit characteristics (such as length and layout), race conditions (rain level in mm and air temperature in Celsius), and first-lap lead status as key factors that influence race outcomes?"

    "Formula 1 (F1) is a premier motorsports competition where the world’s top drivers and automotive manufacturers compete across a series of races on diverse tracks worldwide, vying for the championship title. The starting grid position for each driver is determined in a Saturday qualifying session held the day before the race. Starting grid position in Formula 1 (F1) undoubtedly affects the likelihood of winning a race. Common sense would indicate that starting in pole (first) position would give you the highest likelihood to win the race. Since overtaking is a challenging task that can be amplified on certain circuits, starting in a higher grid position provides a large advantage over lower positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this may not always be the case as, historically, only about 40% of race winners started in pole position<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Some limitations to note are that this study only looked at the statistics of pole position winners and they did not consider any extraneous effects that could impact the eventual winner of the race such as weather conditions nor did it measure the direct advantage of a position by considering the first lap position versus grid position. This study did, however, consider the track type in which it found that tighter tracks give a larger advantage to the driver in pole position than tracks that allow more opportunities for other drivers to overtake each other. The idea that pole position is not necessarily the most advantageous position is backed up by data revealing that there is a negative average difference between starting grid position and final race position<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Some limitations of this study are that they only considered grid position and final race position but, possibly, the most direct measure of grid position advantage is based on the difference between first lap position and grid position. This study also tries to explain their observations by exploring the differences between teams and drivers instead of considering other factors. These observations contribute to our understanding of how starting grid position affects the probability of winning a race. There is, however, room to determine which position provides the largest advantage on each circuit which can help F1 teams come up with different strategies to optimize their chances at success.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that the likelihood of achieving a higher finishing position is greatest for drivers who start in the top two (front row) grid positions and maintain the lead after the first lap, especially on circuits with restricted overtaking opportunities, like Monaco or the Hungaroring. Specifically, we expect that starting grid position, first-lap lead status, and circuit type (street vs. permanent) will interact to shape race outcomes: on overtaking-limited circuits, drivers starting in the front row will have a significant advantage in average finishing position, whereas on high-speed circuits with more overtaking zones, the influence of starting position may diminish, making the first-lap lead more important. Additionally, we predict that adverse weather conditions (such as increased rain levels) will further amplify the advantage in finishing position for drivers starting in a top position or leading after the first lap, as challenging conditions reduce overtaking opportunities for those starting further back."

It is split into multiple different CSV files of which circuits.csv, lap_times.csv, races.csv, and results.csv will be important. Some of the important variables we will be considering are grid (grid position), lap (lap number), and position (lap position). We will also need lat (latitude) and lng (longitude) to pass into our other dataset in order to get weather data. We will need to clean the dataset by removing null data (represented by \\N) where data that is required in our study is missing. We will also preprocess lap_times such that we only look at the first lap so we can see the effects of grid position on who leads the first lap.\n",

    "The Open Meteo API allows us to give a longitude and latitude along with a date in order to pull weather data at a specific location at a specific time. Some of the important variables we will be considering are temperature and amount of rain (in mm) in order to study how these variables affect final positions. The data will have to be preprocessed such that we only pull variables at the specific time of the race and not from the entire day."

    "Regarding terms of use, the F1 data we utilize is publicly available and adheres to licensing agreements. However, we will carefully review and comply with all terms of use specified by the data providers, such as Kaggle, to ensure compliance. We will avoid repurposing or redistributing the data in ways that could violate these terms and will limit our analysis to fair use for educational and analytical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no privacy concerns or terms of use issues regarding the date. The data is public racing data made available on Kaggle. Thereby, we have to responsibly use the data without reselling or republishing it. It is unlikely that the dataset is bias, as it just shows the recoded racing results and grid position. Based on this, we can pretty confidently say there is no bias as the sole type of data is recorded racing data. However, before working on our problem, we will ensure that there is no bias involved in the dataset based on team or driver. Using that, we can try to eliminate team and driver bias, allowing us to make objective conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides team and driver bias, no other issues seem to be apparent based on our data set, as it is purely recording race results. Yet, if we do find something, we will figure out how it impacts our data. We can look back at a particular race to view if anything notable happened, skewing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the consumer side, there are some ethical concerns. These include potential gambling concerns as, if we do find a significant advantage based on grid position, people may be more willing to bet on drivers starting in a certain grid position when they otherwise wouldn't normally bet on such a driver and they may blame this study if their bets do not pay off. Same goes for teams and driver's themselves. This can increase the chances of match-fixing, as we might find another factor that influences race performance. This can increase the amount of illicit activities around F1 as a whole. People might be more tempted to pay off drivers, so other drivers get into a better position on the grid. This is something we need to keep in mind when conducting our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that might arise is team strategy. F1 teams have a very planned out strategy to ensure their success in both qualifiers and the race itself. Currently, a successful outcome is finishing first in both. However, if we conclude that a different grid position provides a larger likelihood of winning a race, we might see teams abusing that information and perform worse during qualifiers on purpose. This would ruin F1, as people love the sport for its speed and strategic maneuvers to get the fastest laps. While ruining the sport, it might also enrage fans and supporters, as it can become less enjoyable to watch. When looking at our results, we have to make sure that it will not ruin the sport and it cannot be used for abusive purposes on the race track.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these concerns, our team has taken steps to ensure that our findings will be presented responsibly, making it clear that race outcomes are influenced by a combination of factors and not solely grid position. Additionally, we will avoid overemphasizing any single factor and provide a comprehensive view of how multiple variables, including track characteristics and weather conditions, interact in shaping race outcomes. We also plan to include disclaimers regarding the limitations of our study and the potential for misuse in gambling contexts. We will be cautious in how we present any findings, highlighting that our analysis is focused on providing insights rather than prescriptive recommendations for teams or bettors."
