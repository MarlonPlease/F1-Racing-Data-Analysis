    "Formula 1 (F1) is a premier motorsports competition where the world’s top drivers and automotive manufacturers compete across a series of races on diverse tracks worldwide, vying for the championship title. The starting grid position for each driver is determined in a Saturday qualifying session held the day before the race. Starting grid position in Formula 1 (F1) undoubtedly affects the likelihood of winning a race. Common sense would indicate that starting in pole (first) position would give you the highest likelihood to win the race. Since overtaking is a challenging task that can be amplified on certain circuits, starting in a higher grid position provides a large advantage over lower positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this may not always be the case as, historically, only about 40% of race winners started in pole position<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). This is backed up by data revealing that there is a negative average difference between starting grid position and final race position<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). These observations contribute to our understanding of how starting grid position affects the probability of winning a race. There is, however, room to determine which position provides the largest advantage on each circuit which can help F1 teams come up with different strategies to optimize their chances at success.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that the likelihood of winning a race is highest for drivers who start in the top two (or front row) grid positions and maintain the lead after the first lap, especially on circuits with restricted overtaking opportunities, like Monaco or the Hungaroring. Specifically, we expect that starting grid position, first-lap lead status, and circuit type (street vs. traditional) will interact to shape race outcomes: drivers in the front row will have a significant advantage on overtaking-limited circuits, whereas on high-speed circuits with more overtaking zones, the impact of starting position may be reduced, making the first-lap lead a more dynamic variable. Additionally, we predict that weather conditions (such as rain) will further amplify the advantage of starting in a top position or leading after the first lap, as difficult conditions make it challenging for those starting further back to gain positions."

    "1\\. The ideal dataset to explore which starting grid position has the highest likelihood of winning a Formula 1 race, and how this varies across different track types and rainy conditions, should include race information such as race and circuit identifiers, race dates, and weather conditions on race day. It should also have the starting grid positions, driver details (including unique driver and team identifiers), and race outcomes like finishing positions and race winners. Key circuit characteristics, such as circuit type, length, number of laps, and altitude, would also be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For the observations; we need observations have data to go atleast 10 years back, and to have as many observations. We would also need multiple observations for each starting position to be able to see the trends, and if there was rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We feel that a reliable weather organization should be the one with the collected weather information, while a reliable source for F1 information should be used for the F1 circuit data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We feel that the data needs to be in a csv format as it is readable for pandas, but we also need to have csv files that include the date and time for the weather so that it can be easily combined with the dates on the F1 dataset to form 1 dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. After searching for real datasets related to Formula 1, I found several potential sources that could provide valuable information for my project. One useful dataset is available on Kaggle, titled “Formula 1 World Championship” which has F1 data from 1950 to 2024) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data?select=results.csv). We also are using weather data from the \"Historical weather API\" (https://openweathermap.org/history).\n",

    "Regarding terms of use, the F1 data we utilize is publicly available and adheres to licensing agreements. However, we will carefully review and comply with all terms of use specified by the data providers, such as Kaggle, to ensure compliance. We will avoid repurposing or redistributing the data in ways that could violate these terms and will limit our analysis to fair use for educational and analytical purposes.\n",

    "There are no privacy concerns or terms of use issues regarding the date. The data is public racing data made available on Kaggle. Thereby, we have to responsibly use the data without reselling or republishing it. It is unlikely that the dataset is bias, as it just shows the recoded racing results and grid position. Based on this, we can pretty confidently say there is no bias as the sole type of data is recorded racing data. However, before working on our problem, we will ensure that there is no bias involved in the dataset based on team or driver. Using that, we can try to eliminate team and driver bias, allowing us to make objective conclusions.\n",

    "Besides team and driver bias, no other issues seem to be apparent based on our data set, as it is purely recording race results. Yet, if we do find something, we will figure out how it impacts our data. We can look back at a particular race to view if anything notable happened, skewing the results."
