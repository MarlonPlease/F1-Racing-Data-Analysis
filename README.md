# Formula 1 Race Outcome Analysis

This group project, completed for a **Data Analysis** course at UC San Diego, investigates how starting grid position, track characteristics, and weather conditions impact Formula 1 race results. Our analysis shows that starting at the front‚Äîparticularly in pole position‚Äîgreatly increases the chances of winning, while track type and temperature further influence race outcomes.

The analysis was performed using **Python**, with:

- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization

üìÅ The final analysis is available in the notebook: [`FinalProject_Group149-FA24.ipynb`](FinalProject_Group149-FA24.ipynb)
